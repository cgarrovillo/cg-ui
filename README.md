# cg-ui

A UI kit I'm working on to learn [StorybookJS](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install), [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/), and the new MUI v5 system (formerly Material-UI)

This also has the added benefit of me treating component reusability as second-nature when working with a team. Plus, a consistent design system across my products.
